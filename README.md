# W4P2-JavaScript

Write a JavaScript program that allows the user to enter 10 integer values,
and stores those values in an array. Then determine whether the array
contains any duplicate values.

Devise multiple test cases for your program, and carry out testing to
ensure that your program delivers the expected results.
